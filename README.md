This repo covers various SQL queries using Common tables expressions
Keywords such as having, join, where and partion by were used together with the window function ROW() to handle some logic
The CTEs have enhanced readability breaking down complex logic into smaller and understandable parts
The CTEs promotes code reuse as they can be referenced multiple times within a single query or across multiple queries within the same script
